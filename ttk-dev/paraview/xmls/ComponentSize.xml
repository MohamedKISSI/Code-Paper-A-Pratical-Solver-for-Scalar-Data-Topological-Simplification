          This plugin computes the connected component of a point-set
data-set and computes their size (number of vertices, number of cells, etc).
The size information is attached on the output, either as point or cell data.
The identifier of each connected component is also attached to the geometry
as point or cell data. This plugin is useful when used in conjunction with
some thresholding, to only display the largest connected components of a
data-set.
